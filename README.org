* blueprint-ts-mode
Major mode for Blueprint ([[https://jwestman.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/blueprint-compiler/]]) based on Treesitter.

* Installation
You need Emacs version >= 29. Your Emacs also needs to be compiled with Treesitter support (~--with-tree-sitter~) which you can check with the variable ~system-configuration-options~.

Install ~blueprint-ts-mode~ from NONGNU ELPA. ~package-install blueprint-ts-mode~.

* Features
- Font Lock
- Indentation
- Eglot integration
- Treesitter based navigation

  These features still need improvement. Feedback and contributions are welcome!
